# Using SAT solvers to find Cover-Free Families

- Inspiration: the source code from Antti Karkinen https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5056507 that covers the problem of finding Cover-Free Families (CFFs) as a Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)

- Remodeling: besides transposing the set-inclusion encoding from Karkinen, we propose, implement, and evaluate, an encoding based on d-disjunct matrices, an extension supporting explicit row-weight constraints, and a compact cyclic variant that reduces the number of covering sets considered.
